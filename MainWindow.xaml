If there isn't a problem with the template, then this tool will not solve your issue. In order to determine whether the issue is with the template or Enable, you should first attempt to run this report on the relevant client. Immediately after, you should run the global version 3 template on the same client. In theory, if the base template completes, but the custom template doesn't, then that indicates an issue with the template. However in cases where both the global report and template do not run, there may be an issue on either the client record, or on the back end of Enable."/>
